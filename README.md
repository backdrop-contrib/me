Me Aliases
======================

Me Aliases provides shortcut paths to the current user's pages, where the word
"me" (or some other word) stands in for the user ID. Examples: user/me,
user/me/edit, etc.

This means logged in users don't have to know or remember their uid, and it
makes it possible to link to user-specific pages from elsewhere in the site or
even from external sources, such as links in emails.
