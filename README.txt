Description
------------------
  Provides shortcut paths to current user's pages, eg user/me, blog/me, 
  user/me/edit, tracker/me etc. This means logged in users no longer have
  to know/remember their uid, and it makes it easier to link to user-specific 
  pages from a site help page (without resorting to using php to put 
  $user->uid in the link).
